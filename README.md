#### Learn and practice on MEAN stack

This aimed to learn and practice on MEAN stack.  
MEAN stack is a full stack web development framework, which use JavaScript in both backend and frontend. It contains:  
MongoDB: the leading NoSQL database, empowering businesses to be more agile and scalable.  
Express: a minimal and flexible node.js web application framework, proving a robust set of features for building single and multi-page, and hybrid web applications.  
AngularJS: lets you extend HTML vocabulary for your application. The resulting environment is extraordinarily expressive, readable, and quick to develop.  
Node.js: a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily building fast, scalable network applications.
